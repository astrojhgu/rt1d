These subdirectories contain parameter files to run various tests of the code,
like the standard RT06 tests (rt06*) and physics 
modules (e.g. secondary_ionization, rt06_2_He, etc.).  The more the better.

To run all test problems, copy $RT1D/scripts/RunAllTests.py to a new 
directory and execute it.  Will copy everything it needs from $RT1D/doc/tests.
