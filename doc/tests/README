These subdirectories contain parameter files to run various tests of the code,
like convergence with spatial resolution (e.g. rt06_*_resolution) and physics 
modules (e.g. secondary_ionization).  The more the better.

To run all test problems, copy the contents of $RT1D/doc/tests to a new 
directory (or don't, I guess), and execute the RunAllTests.py script.
