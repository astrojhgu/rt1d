Eventually I'll put useful information here in case anyone but me ever uses this code.  Here are a few basic things though.

If you're like me, you don't like to run calculations inside of the rt1d/src directory.  I prefer to move a copy of the driver script, RT1D.py, into a new directory.  To make this work, I set the environment variable $RT1D 

export RT1D=/users/jmirocha/Work/mods/rt1d

and set up an alias that allows me to copy the driver script into my current
working directory,

alias   xrt='cp $RT1D/bin/RT1D.py .'
