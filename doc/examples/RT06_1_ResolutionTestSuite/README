To run this entire test suite, do:

###
cp $RT1D/scripts/RT1D.py .
mpirun -np N python RT1D.py -b batch_list.dat
###

where N = # of processors to use.

If you'd prefer not to run all the tests to save some time, 
just remove their parameter files from batch_list.dat.

If you'd like to just run a single test, do something like the following:

###
cp $RT1D/scripts/RT1D.py .
python RT1D.py dx100.dat        # Simulation with 100 grid cells
###
