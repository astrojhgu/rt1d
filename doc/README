Eventually I'll put useful information here in case anyone but me ever uses this code.  Here are a few basic things though.

If you're like me, you don't like to run calculations inside of the rt1d/src directory.  I prefer to move a copy of the driver script, rt1d.py, into a new directory.  To make this work, I set the environment variable $RT1D as follows:

export RT1D=/users/jmirocha/Work/mods/rt1d

I also set the following aliases:

alias   rtpath='export PATH=/Users/jmirocha/Work/mods/rt1d/src:$PATH; 
                export PATH=/Users/jmirocha/Work/mods/rt1d/anl:$PATH; 
                export PYTHONPATH=$RT1D/src:$PYTHONPATH; 
                export PYTHONPATH=$RT1D/anl:$PYTHONPATH'
	
which ensures we have access to everything we need from our current directory, and	
	
alias   xrt='cp $RT1D/bin/rt1d.py .'

which copies what is hopefully the most up-do-date version of the main script into our current directory.
